### Disabled Effects

The node's disabled state can be controlled by `disabled`, `selectDisabled`, `expandDisabled` and `checkDisabled` options.

When the `disabled` option is true, all interactions of the node and the under nodes will be completely disabled, so that they can only maintain the initial state.

You can enable the no cascaded mode (`no-cascaded`) so that it does not effect the under nodes.

The other options can respectively control the interaction disabled state of the node, and will not effect the under nodes.
