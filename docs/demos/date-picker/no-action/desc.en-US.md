### Directly Select

If you want to be able to complete the select after a date is clicked, you can add the `no-action` prop to change the selection mode.

Note that the `outside-cancel` prop will always take effect after adding this prop.

When the `type` prop is `'datetime'`, it only disables the bottom action bar of the panel, and does not change the selection mode.
