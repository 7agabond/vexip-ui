### virtual Handler

Add the `lazy` prop to enable virtual gamepad functionality.

After the virtual handle is enabled, the virtual handle will be used to mark the position during the dragging process, and the panel will be directly transformed to the target position after the dragging.

It is suitable for scenarios where there is a lot of panel content and the performance of real-time adjustment of the panel size is poor.
