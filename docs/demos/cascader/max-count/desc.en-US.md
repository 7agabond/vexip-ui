### Tag Count

Use `max-tag-count` prop to set the maximum value of tags displayed in multi-select mode.

When set to `0`, the maximum value is dynamically calculated inside the component to keep the label displayed on one line.

If you want all labels to show at all times, just set it to `Infinity`.
